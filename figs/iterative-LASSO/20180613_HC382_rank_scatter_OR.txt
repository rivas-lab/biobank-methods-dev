Comparison of Junyangâ€™s LASSO vs. PLINK logistic regression.

We identified 137 SNPs from LASSO and found that 133 SNPs are included in the summary statistics from PLINK. (I suspect PLINK returned NAs for these 4 SNPs).

For these 133 SNPs, we computed the rank of absolute value of coefficient from LASSO (y-axis) and compared it with the rank of effect size (absolute value of log odds ratio) in the PLINK summay statistics (x-axis). Note there are 779,830 SNPs in the PLINK summary statistics.
